shell history tricks :
  !! for saving to history
  ctrl + r -> searching 
  export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups -> removes repeated commands in history
  export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%h %d %H:%M:%S> "
  export HISTSIZE=100000
  every command should be added in the bash profile to save as login again
  What command brings back the entire previous line? - !!
  
pattern matching :
   * matches many characters ex - file*.txt output - file23.txt , file1.txt , filess.txt
   ? matches one of any character - file?.txt output - filea.txt , file1.txt
   [] matches one character in list - file[0-9].txt output - file1.txt , file2.txt
   ls file[[:digit:]].txt
   ls file[[:punct:]].txt
 
Escape characters and quotes
   echo $USER
   echo "My name $USER" - My name sk
   echo 'My name $USER' - My name $USER
   
Command & var substitution
   pdir="/home/sathish/new"
   mkdir -p $pdir -> will create the dir for var pdir
   fname="report"
   touch $pdir/$fname
   touch $pdir/${fname}_january
   
Named pipe - fifo
UNnamed pipe 

File redirects and tees
    ls > /home/ls.txt  -> to overwrite
	ls >> /home/ls.txt -> to append
	ls 2> /home/lsout.err -> stderr
	ls 2>> /home/lsout.err -> stderr append
	ls &> /home/ls.txt -> Redirect both to a file
	sort < /home/lsout.txt > /home/sorted.txt -> redirect in and out of command
	ls | tee lsout.txt -> send output to both file and terminal
	ls | tee -a lsout.txt -> append
	
Linux processes
    ps -> list the current running process PID
	ps -e -> gives all process
	ps -ef
	ps -elF
	top -> realtime
    
	pidof crond
	kill -l -> lists kill signals
	kill (pid)
	sudo systemctl start crond -> to start the process again 
	
	process priority
	  nice -2 top -> setting priority to process
	  renice 5 (pid) -> to reassign new priority to the process
	  
	managing process 
	   watch ps -C dd --format pid,cmd,%cpu
	   dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null
